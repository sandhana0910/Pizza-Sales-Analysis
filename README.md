# Pizza Sales Analysis
## Overview
A compact data analysis project using **SQL** for querying and **Microsoft Excel** for dashboarding.  
The business problem is to analyze pizza sales data to track performance KPIs, identify order trends, and determine best/worst selling items to support decision-making!
### Problem Statement
A pizza store has collected detailed order data (date, time, pizza type, size, quantity, price, etc.,).
The management wants to understand sales performance but they don’t have a direct way to see it.
They need insights such as:
1. Total revenue and average order value
2. When customers order the most (day/hour trends)
3. Which pizza sizes and categories generate more revenue
4. Which pizzas are top sellers and which ones underperform
5. Without these insights, it’s hard for the business to make decisions like menu improvements, promotions, and stock planning.
### Dataset Used: <a href="https://github.com/sandhana0910/Pizza-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/pizza_sales.csv"> view_raw_data </a>
All queries use a single table: `pizza_sales`.  
Key columns used in analysis:
`order_id`, `order_date`, `order_time`, `pizza_name`, `pizza_category`, `pizza_size`, `quantity`, `total_price`
### KPIs and Trends(SQL):
**Total Revenue**  
**Average Order Value (AOV)**  
**Total Pizzas Sold**  
**Total Orders**  
**Average Pizzas per Order**  
**Daily Trend (Orders by Weekday)** 
**Hourly Trend (Orders by Hour)** 
- **% of Sales by Pizza Category / Size**  
- **Total Pizzas Sold by Category** 
- **Top 5 / Bottom 5 Sellers**
